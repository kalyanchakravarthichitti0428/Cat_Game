There are multiple Unity scene files (e.g., 0.unity, 1.unity, etc.), which indicate different levels or parts of the game.

The project contains C# scripts (.cs files) that likely handle various aspects of game mechanics and interactions. For example: 
PlayerMovement.cs: Likely handles the movement of the player character.
nextlevel.cs: Potentially manages level transitions.
stringto3d.cs: Possibly converts string data into 3D objects or coordinates.

Other scripts such as move.cs, rotatee.cs, retybutton.cs likely handle specific game actions such as movement, rotation, and UI button functionalities.

The project also includes various assets (e.g., images) and prefabs (pre-configured game objects) that are used to build the game's visual and interactive elements.
